# SimpliSafe Motion Detection → Alexa Announcement Automation
# 
# This automation triggers when SimpliSafe cameras detect motion
# while the alarm system is armed (away or home mode).
#
# Requirements:
# - SimpliSafe integration configured
# - Nabu Casa Cloud configured (for Alexa integration)
# - Alexa devices discovered as media_player entities
#
# Customization:
# - Update camera_motion_entities list with your actual SimpliSafe camera motion entities
# - Update alexa_devices list with your actual Alexa media_player entity IDs
# - Adjust cooldown_seconds to change minimum time between announcements
# - Modify announcement_message template to customize the spoken alert
